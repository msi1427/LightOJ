1433 - Minimum Arc Distance

Problem link : http://www.lightoj.com/volume_showproblem.php?problem=1433

We know,
Arc distance = Radius * Angle formed in center by the ending points of arc

NB: Angle should be in radian (in C/C++ it is actually in radian)

Find the lengths of all the side length of the triangle OAB.
You already know the coordinates of O , A & B.

if we know the coordinates of 2 points (x1,y1) & (x2,y2)
then distance between these two points are sqrt((x1-x2)*(x1-x2)+(y1-y2)*(y1-y2))

after finding the sides of OAB triangle we can easily find the angle between OA and OB
if we denote OA=a ; OB=b ; AB=c 
and angle between OA and OB is C
then cos(C)=((b*b+a*a-c*c)/(2*b*a))
so C=acos((b*b+a*a-c*c)/(2*b*a)) [acos is the notation of cos inverse]

now we know radius and the angle between the ending point of the arc

now what? 
multiply it....
